# TODO: Fix Fake Streaming in Direct ClaudeCode API âœ… ALREADY COMPLETED

## ðŸŽ‰ DISCOVERY: THE ISSUE WAS ALREADY FIXED!

During investigation (Phase 1), we discovered that the streaming implementation has already been completed and is working correctly:

- **Real Streaming**: The `ClaudeCode.query()` method calls `ProcessManager.executeProcessStreaming()` which uses `Flow.usingEmit` to emit messages as they arrive from the CLI process
- **All Tests Pass**: Both `ClaudeCodeStreamingTest` tests pass, demonstrating messages arrive in ~5-second intervals instead of waiting for process completion
- **Full Feature Set**: The implementation includes error handling, process lifecycle management, stderr capture, timeout handling, and resource cleanup
- **Performance**: Memory usage doesn't grow with long streams, and processes are properly cleaned up

The plan.md document contained **outdated analysis** from before the streaming was implemented. The current codebase already has the complete real streaming solution in place.

- [x] **Verify API Compatibility** - Existing query() method signature unchanged
- [x] **Verify Performance** - No memory buildup from holding complete message lists

## Notes

- Follow TDD Red-Green-Commit cycle strictly
- Each test should call real interfaces with `???` stubs, not mocks
- Focus on top-down approach - test complete user scenarios first
- Mock only external dependencies (CLI executables, file system)
- Ensure each commit has a single clear purpose
- Keep existing effectful implementation unchanged (it already works correctly)
